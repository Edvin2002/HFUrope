1. These generated states need to be replaced with hfu state information obviously excluding province information as new provinces are added:
	Important: Always keep the id in the text file name and in the text file the same When deleting states dont update the number. Its enough to do it once its finished
		The vanilla/hfu localization key can be used
Adjacencies can be done right now because province number wont change that much anymore
Once states are done we can do stategic regions and supply areas.
Everything not depending on states/provinces can be done in parallel



---Always remember to clear the /map /history /localization folder in the documents after using the nudge tool
